I'm trying to work on this project to practice react and keep coding.

I don't have much time because I am working in a restaurant until I find a company. 

I want to try working in mobile first.

I want to make the connexion with the back-end. 
I need to understand de back-end and the database first to make sure we understood each other and my pages match for now.

The API call works with axios. It's ok for development mode. It appears that we would have to make a proxy for deployment.

-SessionList and sessionRow components which allows to map the API response object for Home view.
-click on a session open session/:id page
I used useNavigate because it seems to be more recent than useHistory (https://medium.com/@kgreve14/usehistory-usenavigate-5b383160adba)

I can get sessionId from the url thanks to useParams from react-router-dom (https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-params)
(See also : https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-search-params)
I'll have to get userId.
The back-end is waiting a long and I think sessionId is a string. 
I have to check how to make it work.

Added some navigation links
-Pull les modif du remote repo
-Display name, payor, total amount, date -> onClick -> expands and display amount for each, edit button
-Register / Login Token local storage + passr le token dans le header dans le call Ã  l'API.
________________________________________________________________________________

From Home page I can go on Session page after clicking on session div thanks to the sessionId added ad the and of the url. 
I want to make an API call with userId and sessionId payload.

What does the back-end expect? An object? variables in url? 
How to get sessionId? 
With localStorage? https://blog.logrocket.com/localstorage-javascript-complete-guide/#:~:text=The%20setItem()%20method%20allows,the%20value%20attached%20to%20it.
Or lastIndex? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3730359/extract-url-fragment-using-jquery
What is the best use?
