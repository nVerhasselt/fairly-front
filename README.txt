I am trying to work on this project since a long time.

I don't have much time because I am working in a restaurant until I find a company.

It is very hard for me to chose a technology, and start a new project because there are many possibilities.

I finally relied on my partner advice (he is a developer).

I realize how hard it is to code after a month. 


I want to try working in mobile first.

-Routes (WIP)

-Login page:
    .logo (react icon, will be updated one day)

    .Microsoft connexion button
    .'Inscription' button (Link to inscription page)

-Home page:
    .Fairly App header (no actions on mobile / navBar on desktop)
    .Session list
    .Plus button (popover Add session link / Join a session link)
    .Bottom NavBar for mobile, footer with infos like RGPD etc... in desktop.

-Register page? (low priority)
