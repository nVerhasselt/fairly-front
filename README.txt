I'm trying to work on this project since a long time.

I don't have much time because I am working in a restaurant until I find a company.

It is very hard for me to chose a technology, and start a new project because there are many possibilities.

I finally relied on my partner advice (he is a developer).

I realize how hard it is to code after a month. 

I want to try working in mobile first.


-Routes (WIP)

-Login page:
    .logo (react icon, will be updated one day)
    .Email input
    .Password input
    .Microsoft connexion button
    .'Inscription' button (Link to register page)

-Home page:
    .Fairly App header (title, no actions on mobile / navBar on desktop)
    .Sessions list
    .Plus button (popover Add session link / Join a session link)
    .Bottom NavBar for mobile, footer with infos like RGPD etc... in desktop.

-Register page? (low priority)

_______________________________________________________________________________

Home:
    -Reduce NavFooter padding
    -Find a font for the header 'Fairly App'
    -Match colors

Login:
    -Match colors
    -Remove card
    -Add Microsoft connexion

I'm working on the static pages and style first.
I'd like to use styled components. 
I want a global style, because I'm starting repeating code and that's not good.


Authentication

Login page will be the a first destination of the app.

-Compare the input infos with database and open Home page if their is a matching user.

Axios? Fetch?

My partner made the back-end of the application in .NET. I'm working on the connexion between both apps.
I'm not familiar with .NET.



.Chose fonts for the rest of the app
